# مُخطِّط الزيارات الأسبوعية

A single-file planner for one week of visits. It builds visit schedules for clinical and admin teams.

## What it does
- Builds several valid plans for the week. It respects team makeup (2 clinical + 2 admin at main sites, 2 + 1 at contracted sites), days off, the no-consecutive-days rule, mixed-gender rules, near/far preferences and pairing rules.
- Shows real dates for the week, with previous/next week buttons. Clicking the label jumps back to the current week. Today is highlighted.
- Has two views: by day, or a grid by member showing where each person is each day, their days off and their total.
- Lets you copy the plan as dated text, copy it per member, share it (native share sheet or WhatsApp) and print a clean layout.
- Lets you undo deleting a member or location from the toast.
- Keyboard shortcuts: `G` generates, `←/→` switch plans, `C` copies, `Esc` clears the highlight, `Enter` confirms a name.
- On mobile, the tab bar sits at the bottom of the screen.
- Saves everything in `localStorage` (`visitplan.v1`), including the chosen week and view.

## Fixes
- Visit capacity now comes from the real team size. Before, it used hard-coded pair caps that didn't match the team rules. Removing members now updates the maximum correctly.
- If there are too few clinical/admin members, the app now says so clearly instead of spinning through a pointless search.
- Auto-regeneration no longer shows a toast each time.
- The visits stepper disables at its limits.
- Changing a member's pool updates the counts and capacity.
- The "all days" switch now matches the saved state after a reload.
- Saved data is checked more safely when loading.

## Entry
- `index.html`. No backend and no tables.

## Next steps
- Export to image or PDF.
- Lock a single visit and regenerate the rest.
